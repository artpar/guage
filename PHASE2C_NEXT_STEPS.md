# Phase 2C: Next Steps Plan
## Consistency, Correctness, and Completeness Analysis

**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Current Status:** Week 1 Days 5-6 Complete
**Analysis By:** Claude Sonnet 4.5

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Days 5-6 work is ALREADY COMPLETE!

### Current Verified Status

✅ **Days 1-4:** Cell infrastructure + Type registry + Leaf primitives (5/5)
✅ **Days 5-6:** Node/ADT primitives (4/4) **← ALREADY DONE**
🎯 **Day 7:** Graph primitives (6/6) **← NEXT IMMEDIATE STEP**
⏳ **Week 2-3:** CFG/DFG auto-generation **← PLANNED**

### Implementation Summary

**Progress:** 9/15 structure primitives complete (60%)
**Status:** On track, ahead of schedule
**Risk:** Low - infrastructure solid, pattern established
**Next:** Implement 6 graph primitives (~3-4 hours work)
