# Guage Development Session Start

I'm working on **Guage**, a Turing-complete ultralanguage with pure symbolic syntax.

**Read first:**
1. `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` - Current status and what's next
2. `SPEC.md` - Language specification
3. `docs/INDEX.md` - Documentation navigation

**Working methodology:**
- Feature-by-feature, test-first development
- Update docs as we go (SESSION_HANDOFF.md, SPEC.md)
- Follow governance rules in docs/INDEX.md
- Commit after each complete feature
- No vague terms in doc names (see docs/DOC_PATTERNS.md)

**Principles:**
- Pure symbols only (no English)
- First-class everything (functions, errors, tests, CFG/DFG)
- Single source of truth (link, don't duplicate)
- De Bruijn indices at runtime
- Tests as first-class values

**Session workflow:**
1. Choose next feature from SESSION_HANDOFF.md "What's Next"
2. Write tests first (tests/test_[feature].scm)
3. Implement feature
4. Verify tests pass + no regressions
5. Document in SESSION_HANDOFF.md + SPEC.md
6. Commit with clear message

**Session end:**
1. Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md (executive summary, what's new, what's next)
2. Archive completed notes to docs/archive/YYYY-MM/
3. Update docs/INDEX.md Quick Status
4. Commit documentation

**See SESSION_START_PROMPT.md for complete methodology.**

Ready to work! What's next from SESSION_HANDOFF.md?
