;;; Minimal test - no stdlib, just quoted values through closures
;;;

;;; Test 1: Define quoted value and pass through identity
(≔ my-quoted (⌜ (a b c)))
(≋ :my-quoted-value)
(≋ my-quoted)

(≔ id (λ (x) x))
(≋ :pass-through-id)
(≋ (id my-quoted))

;;; Test 2: Create closure and pass quoted value
(≔ get-head (λ (x) (◁ x)))
(≋ :try-car)
(≋ (get-head my-quoted))
