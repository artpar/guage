;;; Minimal test - no stdlib, just quoted values through closures
;;;

;;; Test 1: Define quoted value and pass through identity
(define my-quoted (quote (a b c)))
(print :my-quoted-value)
(print my-quoted)

(define id (lambda (x) x))
(print :pass-through-id)
(print (id my-quoted))

;;; Test 2: Create closure and pass quoted value
(define get-head (lambda (x) (car x)))
(print :try-car)
(print (get-head my-quoted))
