;;; Test how arguments are passed to closures

;;; Test 1: Pass number through closure
(define double (lambda (x) (+ x x)))

;;; Test 2: Pass symbol through closure
(define return-it (lambda (x) x))

;;; Test 3: Pass list created with cons through closure
(define my-list (cons #1 #2))

(print :pass-cons-list)
(print my-list)
(print (get-car my-list))

;;; Test 4: Define list inline and pass
(print :pass-inline-list)
(print (get-car (cons #3 #4)))

;;; Test 5: Pass quoted expression through closure - just return it
(define quoted-list (quote (a b c)))
(print :return-quoted)
(print (return-it quoted-list))

;;; Test 6: Pass quoted expression and try car
(print :car-of-quoted-via-closure)
(print (get-car quoted-list))
